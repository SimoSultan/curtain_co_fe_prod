## Purpose

The purpose of the app is to migrate the client’s business, along with her ideas, into a dynamic website. This website embodies elegance and sophistication to bring a unique experience to its users.
It would be the client’s platform where she can share her suggestions and expertise in the industry while selling curtains and product samples. The website would also allow interested parties to communicate with the client through email thus expanding her own clientele.

## Wireframes

> ### Desktop

Below are the desktop views of the site. In the essence of time, we have focused on desktop and mobile portrait views of the app and used our spare time to ensure a solid layout and design that the client was happy with. We foresee some small issues and time being spent on ensuring the rest of the tablet views and mobile landscape views, however, when designing these wireframes, a grid like layout was an underlying choice so that Material UI will handle the heavy lifting of the responsive layouts, with small adjustments of course.

> ### Mobile

Below are all the mobile portrait views of the app. In regards to landscape views, we intend to force the portrait view in this orientation but use a container to center it a bit more so that it is not too stretched. We foresee some tweaking of these views however.

> ### Tablet

For tablet, we only decided to do the landing page as to see which nav bar and footer would look the best on each screen size and orientation. That was the main objective for these first few preliminary designs shown below. Tablet landscape orientation is intended to replicate the desktop views. But tablet portrait may require some on the fly tweaking.
